# Interview Scheduler

This is a scheduler where the user can book an appointment. There are 5 appointment slots for each day (Monday-Friday). An appointment can be edited or cancelled if the user wants to. This project is built on **React** and **PostGres SQL**. 

The app is currently deployed on **Netlify** with the backend in **Heroku**. I have also used **CircleCI** to run the tests before the project is deployed to production.
